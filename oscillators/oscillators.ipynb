    "# Electronic Oscillators\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillators are nonlinear systems which take advantage of the circuit nonlinearities to sustain controlled oscillations. Linear circuits would require the circuit poles to reside precisely in the $j\\omega$ axis for oscillations and the amplitude would depend on the magnitude of the impulse applied. Both these conditions make linear oscillators impractical.\n",

    "## Schematic and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the full schematic of the Colpitts oscillator in commom-emitter configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/colpitts_oscillator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The schematic above can be simplified for AC Analysis:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Describing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing functions approximate a nonlinear system using the first harmonic. An oscillator is mainly concerned about the first harmonic behavior (frequency  of oscillation), therefore, the approximation is often adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that the collector current of the oscillator in the schematic above consists of periodic pulses for large values of $V_f$ (feedback voltage), it is shown ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Design-CMOS-Radio-Frequency-Integrated-Circuits-ebook/dp/B00AKE1Q86)) that on the limit of a train of pulses, the amplitude of the first harmonic ($I_1$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_1 = 2 I_{bias} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The large-signal transconductance can be calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_m = \\frac{I_1}{V_f} = \\frac{2 I_{bias}}{V_f} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the AC schematic it's possible to reach the following representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/simp_ac_colpitts_oscillator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent current generator ($G_m V_f$) produces a sinusoid whose amplitude is constantly $2 I_{bias}$ and can be replaced by a constant current sine wave. Using $C_1$ and $C_2$ as an impedance transformer, $R=1/G_m$ can be transformed to $R_p$, a resistance in parallel with $R_L$.\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "n      &= \\frac{C_1}{C_1+C_2} \\\\\n",
    "R_p    &= \\frac{1}{n^2 G_m} \\\\\n",
    "R_{eq} &= \\frac{R_L R_p}{R_L + R_p}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "With this simplification the circuit is simply a parallel RLC with,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "C_{eq}     &= \\frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1+C_2} \\\\\n",
    "\\omega_{o} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C_{eq}}}\n",

    "Assuming the same current flows through the tank circuit during resonance it can be written\n",

    "\n",
    "Now from the equivalent AC circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_f - V_{tank} = 2 I_{bias} R_{eq} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the equations to predict the amplitude of oscillation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "V_f      &= 2 I_{bias} R (1-n) n \\\\\n",
    "V_{tank} &= 2 I_{bias} R (1-n)^2\n",

    "### Admittance Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the AC model to obtain the admittance parameters,\n",

    "### Output Impedance\n",
    "\n",
    "Before adding the inductor and the resistor, one can obtain the oscillator small signal output impedance, to check if the oscillator can startup. This can be achieved checking if the structure have negative resistance (real part of the output impedance).\n",

    "$$C_{eq} = \\frac{C_1 C_2}{C_1+C_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering $R_s$ to be a series load, the condition for oscillation can be written as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ - \\frac{g_m}{\\omega^2 C_1 C_2} < -R_s $$\n",
