    "# Electronic Oscillators\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillators are nonlinear systems which take advantage of the circuit nonlinearities to sustain controlled oscillations. Linear circuits would require the circuit poles to reside precisely in the $j\\omega$ axis for oscillations and the amplitude would depend on the magnitude of the impulse applied. Both these conditions make linear oscillators impractical.\n",

    "Describing functions approximate a nonlinear system using the first harmonic. An oscillator is mainly concerned about the first harmonic behavior (frequency  of oscillation), therefore, the approximation is often adequate.\n",

    "Knowing that the collector current of the oscillator in the schematic above consists of periodic pulses for large values of $V_f$ (feedback voltage), it is shown ([here](https://www.amazon.com/Design-CMOS-Radio-Frequency-Integrated-Circuits-ebook/dp/B00AKE1Q86)) that on the limit of a train of pulses, the amplitude of the first harmonic ($I_1$) is:\n",
